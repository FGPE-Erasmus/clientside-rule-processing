Clientside application and utilities allowing seamless connection between client and server.

## Important!

The application is not ready to be shipped yet due to a few minor issues, todo list:

1. connect to real server URLs in 'browser' module
2. compatibility issues with last 5 (unimplemented yet) student API endpoints
3. Implement KeyCloak auth.
4. expose stable public API
5. Document installation & usage section
6. Document API section
