# Clientside Rule Processing

Clientside application used for event processing.

## Important!

The application is not ready to be shipped yet due to a few minor issues, todo list:

- ~~create seamless integration with JS via WASM (client-side)~~
- compatibility issues with last 5 (unimplemented yet) student API endpoints (server-side)
- implement KeyCloak auth for student API endpoints (server-side)
- ~~expose stable public API (client-side)~~
- document installation & usage section (client-side & server-side)
- document API section (client-side & server-side)

## Features

- rock solid and fast (thanks to Rust)
- compiled to WASM, efficient and portable format
- flexible parsing with `pest` parser
